## WHO 
{: #who}

Nice to meet you. I'm Santi Bello.  
I'm a developer from Galicia, Spain who began as a self-taught, currently working remote as a Software Developer in PHP and JavaScript.
<br/>  
<center>< \ ></center>  
<br/>
I like working both Front and Backend, being Backend my preferred choice for its vast abstraction level. Also I enjoy studying and applying good practices and metodologies.  
<br/>

<br/>
As as hobby, aside of staying up-to-date with tecnologies I arrange social gaming events since 2014, having performed more than 140 events within our organisation. Don't hesitate to [contact][contact] me!
